# Practice with Loops
# 1.) The amount of lines in each frame are 38.
# 2.) The initializer means distance from the left side. The condition affects the distance from the right side, while the increment creates the amount of lines per frame.

# Practicing with Arrays
# 1.) The loop body happens six times while moving the mouse, and during each cycle.
# 2.) By making the number in the increment larger, the spacing between the rings gets larger as well.
# 3.) To make the trail of rings longer, make the number in the increment smaller. Changing the "10" to a "1" creates a trail of more rings.
